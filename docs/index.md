# ROOT-Sim core documentation

The continuous integration service of ROOT-Sim automatically rebuilds the internal documentation every time
that a development version or a stable version is released.

We release a stable version seldom, after a significant correctness and performance tests have been carried out.
Therefore, we provide here links to both versions of the documentation, as they can be significantly different.
